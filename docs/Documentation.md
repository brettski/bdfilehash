# BD File Hash Overview
BD File Hash is a convenient file hashing and hash compare tool for Windows which currently works with MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, and SHA-512 algorithms. The goal behind BD File Hash is to have a super simple to use hashing tool which doesn't force you to copy/paste hash strings between documents and applications to match them.

Checking file hashes has always been a pain in the arse to me.  There has never been an easy, straight forward way to do it.  Command line just blows and most Windows apps fell short of being easy or convenient.  I know BD File Hash isn't exactly all of these things, but it certainly a good start.
